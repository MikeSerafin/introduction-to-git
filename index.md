# Library 501 - Introduction to Git

## Workshop description
With this introduction to Git, we will go over the basics on Git and GitHub.  We will go over setting up a GitHub account, explaining basic commands like clone, add, and commit, setting up a repository on GitHub, and how to recover old versions of files.

**Note**: This lesson is derived from the [Library Carpentries Introduction to Git](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/)

## Setup
1. Create a free [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account and confirm your email.
2. Download and install Git for your operating system: https://git-scm.com/downloads (Note: Git for Windows comes bundled with the Git BASH terminal that allows you to use UNIX-style commands on Windows)
3. Configure Git by opening a terminal and entering the following commands:
```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "your@email"
```
